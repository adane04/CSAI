This respository contains an implemetnaiton of a novel Clustering Stability Assessment Index (CSAI) in the domain of unsupervised learning. CSAI is  motivated by the news event detection task based the GDELT news database in which we would like to assess the quality and consistency of  news text clusters. The proposed CSAI validation index leverages a data resampling approach, prediction analysis, aggregation of features in clusters, and a distance based on mean squred error to assess teh validity and  stability of news clusters.
